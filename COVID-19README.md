This project analyzes global COVID-19 case, death, and vaccination trends using a historical dataset covering 2019â€“2021.
The dataset only contains data from 2019-2021 because I wanted to highlight early-pandemic dynamics and demonstrate data cleaning, SQL querying, and dashboard creation skills.
It is not intended to reflect current case counts or vaccination rates, but rather to showcase analytical methods and visualization techniques on a complete, fixed-range dataset.

Skills & Tools:

SQL: Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, Temp Tables, Views, Aggregations

Database: Microsoft SQL Server

Visualization: Tableau

Data Source: Mathieu, E., Ritchie, H., Ortiz-Ospina, E. et al. A global database of COVID-19 vaccinations. Nat Hum Behav (2021). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01122-8

Objectives:
Identify countries and continents with the highest infection and death rates.
Measure vaccination rollout progress over time.
Explore correlations between vaccination rates and mortality decline.


Key Insights:

- The top 10 countries by infection rate were mostly in Europe and South America.
  
- Recorded 150.57 million confirmed cases and 3.18 million deaths globally.
  
- Average global death rate over the period was ~2.11%.
  
- Europe experienced the highest total deaths, followed by North America and South America.

- The United States reached an estimated 19.11% population infection rate by the end of 2021, the highest among the countries shown.
  The United Kingdom followed with 14.93%, while Mexico remained lower at 3.32%.

- Global infection rates rose slowly through early 2020, then sharply increased from late 2020 into 2021, matching the timing of major pandemic waves.
Estimates for late 2021 indicate the U.S. and U.K. would continue leading infection percentages if trends persisted (This did turn out to be true).
