This project is meant to practice cleaning messy data. I used housing data as it had very messy data which was perfect to practice SQL skills. The project is meant to standardize formats, populate missing values, restructure addresses, and remove unecessary data. 

Skills & Tools:

SQL: Joins, Window Functions, CTE, String Functions, Data Type Conversion, NULL Handling, Aggreate Functions 

Database: Microsoft SQL Server
